# SLOT-MACHINE
This is a code for creating a slot machine in python,
 the code works on the concept of getting same values on three slots by using random 
module and a bit of tkinter and i've even added certain features to add the records to a databases
 and a registration window.
 Well this is just a basic approach to making a slot machine.


                                                                                                                                                                        


Below i've provided some information on the working process of the code

Here are some of the screenshots of the game :

In these images we can see that if in case the user wins it shows a message box displaying the message that the user has won.
<br>
NOTE : JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE INPUT PHONE NUMBER SHOULD BE SAME IN BOTH THE COLUMNS. IF PUT IN THE INCORRECT NUMBER IT WILL SCREW IT UP.
<br>
NOTE : RECORDS CAN BE VIEWED BY ACCESSING THE RESPECTIVE SQL-DATABASE ASSOCIATED WITH STORING THE TABLES WHICH CONTAIN THE USER BASED INFO.
